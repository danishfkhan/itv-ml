For example, consider that you're solving the simple supervised learning problem of pet image classification with two target classes—dog and cat. You've gathered the training dataset and implemented the classifier using your favorite deep learning toolkit, and after a while, the model that has converged demonstrates excellent performance. Good? Definitely! You've deployed it and left it running for a while. Then, after a vacation on some seaside resort, you discover that dog haircut fashions have changed, and a significant portion of your queries are now misclassified, so you need to update your training images and repeat the process again. Definitely not! <br>\n",

    "You may be familiar with the notion of supervised learning, which is the most studied and well-known machine learning problem. Its basic question is: how do you automatically build a function that maps some input into some output, when given a set of example pairs? It sounds simple in those terms, but the problem includes many tricky questions that computers have only recently started to deal with some success. There are lots of examples of supervised learning problems, including the following:\n",

The main objective is to learn some hidden structure of the dataset at hand. One common example of such an approach to learning is the clustering of data. This happens when our algorithm tries to combine data items into a set of clusters, which can reveal relationships in data. <br>\n",

If your agent decides to do inefficient things, then the observations will tell you nothing about what they have done wrong and what should be done to improve the outcome (the agent will just get negative feedback all the time). If the agent is stubborn and keeps making mistakes, then the observations can make the false impression that there is no way to get a larger reward—life is suffering—which could be totally wrong. In machine learning terms, it can be rephrased as having non-i.i.d data.

The problem is that too much exploration may also seriously decrease the reward (not to mention that the agent can actually forget what they have learned before), so, we need to find a balance between these two activities somehow. This exploration/exploitation dilemma is one of the open fundamental questions in RL."

For example, looking at the simplest model of the weather in some city, we can observe the current day as sunny or rainy, which is our state space.

In most cases, the process can have an infinite (or large) amount of transitions. As it is not very practical to deal with infinite values, we would like to limit the horizon we calculate values for. Gamma with a value less than 1 provides such a limitation. On the other hand, if you're dealing with finite-horizon environments (for example, the TicTacToe game which is limited by at most 9 steps), then it will be fine to use gamma = 1. As another example, there is an important class of environments with only one step called Multi-Armed Bandit MDP.
